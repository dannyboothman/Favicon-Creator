How it works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FaviconCreator allows you to create a favicon using simple inputs, and selection options. It:

- Allows you to have a FontAwesome icon or text as your main visual.
- Gives you the ability to change the color and background color.
- Provides options for which image sizes you which to download. 
- Provides options for which file type to download. 
- Provides HTML code for your projects.



Why?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to be a quick solution for many web developers across the world who may have
left their creative skills at home and need a favicon for their project ASAP.

It's also a way for me to give something small back to the community I love <3
